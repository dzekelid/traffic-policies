  title: AWS Route 53 API Update Traffic Policy Instance
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Updates the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone that were
    created based onthe settings in a specified traffic policy version.Send a POST
    request to the /2013-04-01/trafficpolicyinstance/traffic policy ID            resource.
    The request body must include a document with anUpdateTrafficPolicyInstanceRequest
    element.When you update a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 continues to
    respond to DNS queriesfor the root resource record set name (such as example.com)
    while it replaces one group ofresource record sets with another. Amazon Route
    53 performs the following operations:Amazon Route 53 creates a new group of resource
    record sets based on the specified trafficpolicy. This is true regardless of how
    substantial the differences are between theexisting resource record sets and the
    new resource record sets. When all of the new resource record sets have been created,
    Amazon Route 53 starts to respondto DNS queries for the root resource record set
    name (such as example.com) by using thenew resource record sets.Amazon Route 53
    deletes the old group of resource record sets that are associated with theroot
    resource record set name.
